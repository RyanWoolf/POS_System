## **About this project**
----
As of 2023, Hospitality service is moving onto contactless technology such as self-order devices. But still, in fine dining restaurants, diners prefer to be served by their waiters face-to-face rather than contactless as they can feel humanity through even a small talk.  
Based on easy and fast functions, this project is not only for employees who take orders and enter them on the POS device, but also for chefs who start cooking by reading printed orders (or orders printed on the screen), and managers who manage menus and calculate sales to experience and deliver more efficient services.

This project is extended from the previous [API WebServer Project](https://github.com/RyanWoolf/API_Webserver).  The main purpose of this project is for demonstration of skilled full-stack developing.

  - Intuitive UI/UX
  - Light/Dark mode
  - Add/delete staff using Authentication & Authorization.
  - Admin can make/delete Menu with price, ingredients, etc
